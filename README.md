# Go Learning Journey - Golan  البيان في أركان 

Welcome to my Go learning repository! This is where I’ll document my journey to mastering the Go programming language, focusing on key concepts and practical implementations.

## 📚 Learning Objectives
1. **Fundamentals**:
   - Go syntax and basic constructs
   - Variables, types, and functions
   - Loops, conditionals, and control flow

2. **Intermediate Concepts**:
   - Pointers and structs
   - Arrays, slices, and maps
   - Error handling

3. **Concurrency**:
   - Goroutines
   - Channels
   - Synchronization (Mutex, WaitGroups, etc.)

4. **Advanced Topics**:
   - Go modules and packages
   - Memory management and optimization
   - Testing and benchmarking
   - Go’s standard library

## 🚀 Projects
I’ll be applying these concepts to real-world projects, including:
- CLI applications
- Web servers using Go’s `net/http` package
- Concurrent applications

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `basics/` - Contains fundamental concepts and code snippets
- `intermediate/` - Focus on structs, slices, and maps
- `concurrency/` - Examples of goroutines, channels, and concurrency patterns
- `projects/` - Real-world applications and implementations

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources
- [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/)
